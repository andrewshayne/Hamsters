- #1 priority: think of new central game mechanic AND theme
- make room class/system/etc.
- make generic hitbox/sprite class(es)
- work on room connectivity, and matching minimaps!
- collision system
	- for now, check an object against every other object?
	- later, do an upper-right portion of a matrix?

Should I make an AABB class for everything that has a rect??? This would solve problems involving getting position relative to the center/top-left corner and stuff
